         <h1>Beginnings</h1>
         <p>In 2014, I was taking a traditional game design class at Webster University.  As a final project, 
            we had to prototype and present a playable game to the class.  I grew up in the 1990's, in the height
            of the "Pokemon TCG" and "Magic: The Gathering" eras, where collectable card games had a thriving subculture.
            One of my early memories is from my 10th birthday, opening a Japan-imported Pokemon Fossil set booster pack, shocked 
            and delighted by the holographic Mew card that emerged like a shining artifact from that sacred plastic reliquary.
         </p>
         <p>
            A somewhat unique property of so-called "deck builder" games is that there are different types and levels of play that 
            naturally emerge from the game's structure.  Since the collection of individual cards and the assembly of sets of cards into decks 
            (according to the rules of the game) is part of the game itself, it is possible to participate in the game and surrounding 
            community without ever playig competitively or even knowing the game's full rules.  Some people will amass cards simply for the 
            thrill of doing so, creating a whole social barter economy around rare or desirable cards.  Others will desire the competitive 
            aspects of the game, learning the rules in depth and participating in tournaments or events.
         </p>  
         <p>
            Curated starter sets allow even beginners to jump in and have fun quickly, while community events such as "draft tournaments" 
            (in which the cards themselves are provided by the event and a series of "draft" rules are applied to allow competitors to build decks from them) 
            allow even those who can't afford to collect their own sets of highly desirable cards to experience the fun of playing as part of a community.
         </p>
         <p>
            Inspired by the games of my early years, I started work on the ruleset for a new deck-building card game.  Using ideas for an earlier, discontinued 
            project, I wanted the premise of the game to be a conflict between rival "orders" (players) in a medieval-fantasy type setting.  Each card would repreent 
            a subject of the player, which they could then add to their deck.  Decks would have limits on how many duplicate cards or cards of the same "rank" were allowed, 
            forcing less powerful cards to still see play and encouraging players to look for complementary pairings.  
         </p>
         <p>
            The "twist" on this otherwise well-trodden bit of thematic ground was an astrological element, in which the arrangement of the heavenly bodies in 
            the skies of the game's fictional world would actually play a role in the game.  For example, when a card representing a knight of the "Sanctum" order is 
            struck, the damage is reduced based on how many celestial bodies are currently in that knight's favored constellation, making the game dynamic in that 
            certain cards would perform better or even switch roles under certain conditions.  Timing and prediction become important strategic elements.  An early version 
            of the rules and a few demo cards was plenty good enough for my class demonstration, but I continued working on the game afterwards.

         <h1>The&nbsp;Basics</h1>
         <p>
            Each player builds a deck according to a ruleset that specifies how many of each type of card they are allowed to include.  At the start of the game, 
            each player is allowed to start with their highest-ranking card in their hand, and then shuffle their deck and draw 11 more.  Six cards are played, while 
            six remain in the player's hand.  Players are allocated five "energy" to spend per turn, which is tracked with a token on the board.
         </p>
         <p>
            The playing area consists of two rows of three cards for both players.  The first row is the "front line," and is able to interact directly with 
            the other player's front line.  The "back line," or "castle," can only be hit by the opponent's front line if the entire front line is first removed 
            from play.  Certain cards (such as "Sanctioned Assassin") can bypass some of these restrictions, while other cards (such as "Militiaman") have wildly 
            different effects on each line.  In general, the cards on the front line are there to attack the other player's cards and the back line is there for 
            supporting actions.  There are rules for drawing new cards to the hand, replacing cards that have been defeated, swapping cards between lines, and 
            swapping undamaged cards in the back line with cards in the player's hand.  The match continues until one player runs out of playable cards or resigns.

         <h1>The&nbsp;Layers&nbsp;Build</h1>
         <p>
            The astrological element of the game presented a challenge.  Thematically, I wanted it to be predictable, but not <i>perfectly</i> predictable.  Whether this was representative 
            of the game world's incomplete understanding of celestial movement, a sort of metaphysical consensus-reality effect, or some combination of the two would be 
            left open to the players' interpretation.  Regardless, I needed to add a system for both tracking the positions of the four "planets" and for determining where 
            they would be on the next turn.  This necessitated the addition of a board to the game, with tokens to track the celestial bodies.
         </p>
         <p>
            I considered a dice roll for determining motion on the next turn, but felt that it didn't work thematically.  Even if the dice were included and nothing out of the 
            ordinary occured on all but a small percentage of rolls, it still felt entirely random.  Eventually, I settled on using an entirely seperate deck of cards to determine 
            the outcome.  This added yet another layer of physical complexity to the game, but came with the advantage of being far more versatile.  The likeliness of any particular 
            outcome could be controlled by simply adding more of that card, and the card itself could carry special rules that would have been frustrating and time-consuming to attach 
            to a dice table.  Something about learning the motion of the heavens by drawing a themed card felt a lot more engaging as well.  These cards became known as "parallax cards."
         </p>
         <p>
            The playable cards themselves also frequently carried special rules.  Some cards had "passive" effects, defined on the card, that would take effect 
            as long as they were in play.  Playtesters generally liked the complexity that this added, as each card felt "unique," although it made balancing 
            considerably more difficult.

         <h1>Roadblocks</h1>
         <p>
            One core issue with the game involved the "armor" system.  Each card has both a "HP" value (its health, or "hit points") and an "AR" value (its "armor rating").  Armor is simple in concept - 
            incoming damage is reduced by the AR number, unless it comes from a source that specifically says to modify or ignore that.  It is meant to represent durable cards, like knights, without 
            simply giving them bloated HP values that are hard to counter.  Unfortunately, with the kinds of numbers involved, the difference between AR 1 and 2 is 
            fairly dramatic.  The difference between AR 2 and 3 is, gameplay-wise, even more dramatic, as the vast majority of the game's damage-dealing abilities do 4 damage or less.  
            Upping damage values across the board negatively affects the game in other areas, and lowering armor ratings across the board is not enough to make the threshold of 3 
            unattainable without removing certain cards that played well with lower armor ratings.  Introducing more cards that could cut or ignore armor was a band-aid solution 
            that badly limited deckbuilding and never really got to the heart of the problem.
         </p>
         <p>
            Through playtesting, I also came to the conclusion that the game's main victory condition had its own issues.  The game ran very long, as even more experienced 
            players struggled to break through an entire deck in anything under an hour.  The deck size was already as lean as it reasonably could be, and frustrating situations 
            in which both players lost their most powerful cards early and were forced to slog it out with their weak ones were too common.  To make the game play faster, cards 
            needed to be removed from play more quickly, but this made each decision feel less satisfying and made strategies involving certain combinations of cards too difficult 
            to actually execute.  I was confronted with the reality that <i>Parallax</i> somehow played both too slow and too fast at the same time, and this wasn't an easy problem to 
            solve without effectively starting over.
         </p>
         <p>
            In 2018, my personal life got busier, and I stopped working on the project shortly after a bad breakup.  The game could never quite hold the shape that I wanted it to be.  
            As with a great many game prototypes, some of the ideas worked well, some didn't.  As a game design major, Parallax was a deeply meaningful learning experience, 
            and perhaps I'd like to revisit it someday in the future.
